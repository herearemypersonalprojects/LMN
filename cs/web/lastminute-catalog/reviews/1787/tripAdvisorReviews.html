              <div class='comments-title'> Pretty good for biz trip </div>
              <p>I stayed at this place recently on a biz trip to RDU. I like the proximity to the airport, cleanliness, staff and room comfort. I think there is scope to improve the breakfast menu and options. All in all, pretty good deal!</p>

              <div class='comments-title'> clean and convenient </div>
              <p>After spending all day in the Philadelphia airport after many cancelled flights we finally got a late flight to Raleigh. Upon arrival we called many hotels and this was the only one who still had a shuttle working,   it was 11pm and we had a child with us.  The driver said 10-15 minutes but it was more like 4 minutes!  She was so nice and friendly and even checked us in when we arrived.
The room was very clean and super comfy beds, so welcome after 8 hrs in an airport!
The next day the driver was kind enough to bring us to Hertz to rent a car. All in all a great stay.</p>

              <p>you pay for that if you try to work in your room in the afternoon, or if you try to sleep in, in the morning.  Right under the take-off paths, so it was noisy at 6am.  Otherwise, it is a typical Courtyard that caters to travelers/business types.  The staff was very friendly, rooms are clean.</p>
