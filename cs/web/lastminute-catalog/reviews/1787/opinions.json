Upon arrival we called many hotels and this was the only one who still had a shuttle working,   it was 11pm and we had a child with us.  The driver said 10-15 minutes but it was more like 4 minutes!  She was so nice and friendly and even checked us in when we arrived.\nThe room was very clean and super comfy beds, so welcome after 8 hrs in an airport!\nThe next day the driver was kind enough to bring us to Hertz to rent a car. All in all a great stay.","OwnerResponse":{"published_date":"Jun 11, 2014 9:52:07 AM","id":"209876894","author":"jack l, General Manager de Courtyard Raleigh-Durham Airport, a répondu à cet avis","title":"Réponse du propriétaire","text":"Dear Julieccr, \r\nThank you for staying with us and submitting a positive review about our \u201cclean and convenient\u201d hotel.

Right under the take-off paths, so it was noisy at 6am.  Otherwise, it is a typical Courtyard that caters to travelers/business types.

We are definitely convenient to the airport, but we regret that the airport noise was a problem during your stay. We rarely receive complaints about airport noise unless the airport changes the flight path due to wind currents. Nevertheless, we are very sorry that the airport noise prevented you from sleeping-in and working from your room. Should this occur in the future, we would be happy to change your room location so you can rest. Additionally, please feel free to work in our lobby / Bistro area since our complimentary wireless internet is available throughout the entire hotel. Thank you for your comments about the staff and rooms. We are delighted that you found the staff to be friendly and the rooms to be clean. We value your business and hope to see you again.\r\nSincerely,\r\nJack Lucido, General Manager","lang":"en"},"type":"review","ratingImageUrl":"http://www.tripadvisor.fr/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png","lang":"en","url":"http://www.tripadvisor.fr/ShowUserReviews-g49369-d115566-r205257558-m11068-Courtyard_Raleigh_Durham_Airport-Morrisville_North_Carolina.html#review205257558","location_id":"115566","id":"205257558","title":"Convenient to the Airport, but....","subratings":{"Emplacement":"4","Service":"5","Propreté":"4","Literie":"3","Chambres":"4","Rapport qualité / prix":"4"},"rating":3,"user":{"username":"Dave5260","user_location":{"id":"35152","name":"Norcross, Géorgie"}}}]}
